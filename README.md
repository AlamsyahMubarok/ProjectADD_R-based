# Health Intervention Prioritization in Japan Based on Mortality Analysis

This project aims to identify priority health interventions in Japan by analyzing disease-related mortality rates using clustering, regression, and outlier detection techniques. The analysis was conducted using **RStudio** as part of the *Data and Diagnostic Analytics* coursework.

## Project Objectives

- Identify diseases with the highest mortality rates in Japan.
- Group similar disease patterns using **Clustering (K-Means)**.
- Apply **Regression Analysis** to explore relationships between disease variables.
- Detect anomalies using **Outlier Detection** to highlight unusual trends.
- Provide data-driven recommendations for **public health prioritization**.

## Tools & Technologies

- **RStudio** (R programming language)
- Libraries: `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `stats`, `cluster`, `factoextra`
- Dataset: Public health and mortality statistics from Japan (2023-2024)

## Analytical Approach

1. **Data Cleaning**: Preprocessing and handling of missing values.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualization of mortality distributions.
3. **K-Means Clustering**: Grouping diseases based on similarity in impact.
4. **Linear Regression**: Analyzing influence of disease attributes on mortality.
5. **Outlier Detection**: Identifying high-risk or inconsistent health indicators.

## Key Findings

- Several disease groups exhibit consistently high mortality rates.
- Strong linear relationships found between age groups and death counts in specific clusters.
- Certain diseases stood out as **statistical outliers**, requiring urgent attention.

## Outcome

The project resulted in a clear, interpretable classification of disease threats and produced recommendations that can guide **health policy prioritization** in Japan.
